# This is a placeholder for the actual icon file
# In a real implementation, you would need an actual .ico file here
# You can create one using tools like GIMP, Paint.NET, or online converters

# Recommended icon specifications for Windows:
# - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 pixel sizes
# - Use the Herbie logo or a racing-themed icon
# - Should be professional and easily recognizable in the system tray

# Temporary solution: Use a simple colored square
# In production, replace this with actual icon data
